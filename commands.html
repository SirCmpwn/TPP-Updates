            <h1>Live Update Commands</h1>
            <p>Be in #tppmods in irc.freenode.net. Talk to the bot there and use these commands:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>.update category "title" "description" time</strong>: Categories are Travel, Roster, Items, Battle, Commentary, Meta. Time and description optional, default time is the time the update was published.</li>
                <li><strong>.levelup pokemon</strong>: Levels up a Pokemon.</li>
                <li><strong>.catch "species" level "in-game name" "nickname"</strong>: Adds a Pokemon. Do not use this if the Pokemon is immediately boxed. Add moves with:</li>
                <li><strong>.learn pokemon "move"</strong>: Adds a move to a Pokemon's moveset.</li>
                <li><strong>.forget pokemon "move"</strong>: Forgets a move.</li>
                <li><strong>.release pokemon</strong>: Also used for boxing Pokemon.</li>
                <li><strong>.pickup "item"</strong>: Adds this item to our inventory.</li>
                <li><strong>.drop "item"</strong>: Drops/uses an item.</li>
                <li><strong>.goal "goal"</strong>: Updates the goal.</li>
                <li><strong>.badge "name"</strong>: Acquires a badge.</li>
                <li><strong>.money amount</strong>: Money.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Times are noted in the form of "1d1h1m1s"</p>
            <p><strong>Remember to use the quotes where required!</strong></p>
            <h2>Examples</h2>
            <p>You want to make a comment on how the battle's going down: <code>.update commentary "Bird Jesus poisoned" "Bird Jesus is in some trouble, let's hope he pulls through"</code></p>
            <p>This sets the title of the update to "Bird Jesus poisoned", and the extended commentary is "Bird Jesus is in some trouble..."</p>
            <p>Say we catch a pidgey: <code>.update roster "Red catches a Pidgey"</code>. This doesn't include an extended description - it's optional.</p>
            <p>If you want to add an event in the past, try something like: <code>.update battle "Red vs Blue, Blue wins" "Description goes here" 4d5h3m10s</code></p>
            <p>This will add the event at 4 days, 5 hours, 3 minutes, and 10 seconds from the start of Twitch Plays Pokemon (aka the timer shown on the stream).</p>
            <h2>Notes</h2>
            <p>If we use <i>or</i> drop an item, use <code>.drop "item name"</code> to indicate that change. Also, use <code>.catch</code> only when Pokemon are added to the
            party, and <code>.release</code> when Pokemon are removed from the party. Don't use it when we catch a Pokemon and send it to the PC. You <b>should</b> use 
            <code>.catch</code> and <code>.release</code> when we move Pokemon to/from the PC. It updates the party on the front page.</p>
            <p>One last thought: the only command that adds an update is <code>.update</code>. The rest modify the other parts of the live update page, like the inventory.</p>
